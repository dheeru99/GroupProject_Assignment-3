This application is a platform for people to find medical resources in different cities and communities. 
The system admin can operate all CRUD operations in the application. The admin has to add the city details in which different communities can be created. Every Community has different hospitals and houses. First, the houses present in the community, the community can have the details of the houses situated and also the details of the persons living in the Houses.
Community admin can able to modify and remove the data from the community.
